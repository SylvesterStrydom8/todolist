To-Do List Project
This is the first of many C++ projects that I am planning to undertake. Although this To-Do list application is quite simple, I have learned a number of important concepts.

References ('&')
I learned how references work and when to use them. Initially, the symbol seemed intimidating, but I now understand their utility and will be using them frequently in the future.

I/O
I familiarized myself with the basic workflow of input and output (I/O). I believe this is crucial to master, as I will be using it extensively in future projects.

Vectors
I gained substantial knowledge about using vectors. While I am not yet certain how useful they will be in the long run, I plan to use arrays in my next project to expand my understanding.

File Handling
I employed basic file handling techniques to read from and write to a text file. I am eager to delve deeper into this topic and enhance my skills.

Functions
I learned the importance of declaring functions at the beginning of the file, a practice known as function declarations, and defining their bodies later, known as function definitions.

Next Steps
I will soon begin working on my next project. In the meantime, I intend to add more features to this To-Do list application. I am considering incorporating task priorities and due dates.
